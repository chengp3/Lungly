# Lung Nodule Detection

This is the code repository for the lung nodule detection and classification project. Will be using the Kaggle dataset along with supplementary LUNA16 data as needed. Developed in co-op with Brendan Berger.



<!---LUNA.ipynb contains code that takes the first subset, locates the nodules based on the annotations provided with the dataset, and extracts 3 slices (nodule center, and slice above and below it), as well as providing a mask for each slice with tissue directly surrounding it. Currently the mask selects area based on the diameter of the nodule provided in the annotations but it may be useful to use a set diameter (32x32 ?).
